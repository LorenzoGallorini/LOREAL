    <!--
    px
        Short for pixel.
        One pixel corresponds to one onscreen pixel, no matter
        what the display density is.
        Because pixels do not scale appropriately with device
        display density, their use is not recommended.

    dp
        Short for density-independent pixel and usually
        pronounced “dip.” You typically use this for margins, pad‐
        ding, or anything else for which you would otherwise specify
        size with a pixel value. One dp is always 1/160 of an inch on
        a device’s screen. You get the same size regardless of screen
        density: When your display is a higher density, density-inde‐
        pendent pixels will expand to fill a larger number of screen
        pixels.

    sp
        Short for scale-independent pixel. Scale-indepen‐
        dent pixels are density-independent pixels that also take into
        account the user’s font size preference. You will almost al‐
        ways use sp to set display text size
